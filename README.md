# Anny-s-Sound-Library

Welcome to Anny's Sound Library! This is Anny's sound journey since 1993. She learned to play the piano and flute when she was a child. During senior high school, she joined the rock music club and was active as a drummer. After having her exchange student life in Ireland, she can play the Tin Whistle which is one of the Irish traditional instruments.
The broadcast in the library is from the high-speed rail station in her hometown, Changhwa, Taiwan. The existence of the station shortens the distance between her and her hometown. The patterns showing in the library are inspired by the iron windows in Taiwan.

This application is built in Processing using the Sound library.
